# Logistic-Regression

You have seen Multiple Linear Regression model in which the dependent variable is continous but with the Logistic regression, the Dependent variable is Categorical. Logistic Regression is used when the value of our decisional variable is in binary i.e 0 0r 1 ( No / Yes).

The CSM Dataset which contain the details of 232 movies released in the year 2018. The attributes of Data Set included movie rating, likes, dislikes, comments, number of genres involved, total budget of the movie, gross, number of screens dedicated to the film, number of sequels ad total number of views. 

Here, my primary objective is to check the relationship between the success of a movie and the related attributes. I am going to create a response variable called "Hits", where a rating of 6.0 or above is considered to be a hit movie and less than that a "Flop". I will then explore my relations of hits with number of likes, comments and screens.

For the coding purpose, i will use SAS.
